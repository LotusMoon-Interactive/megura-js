# ðŸš€ Future Developments

### **NFT collections with unique status builds**

One of the exciting developments planned for Megura is the implementation of NFT collections that have their own unique status builds. This means that depending on the lore and concept of the NFT collection, different builds will be available for players to choose from. For example, if a player wants a particular stat build, but doesn't hold the NFT that has it, they can purchase a "save file" of that build from another player who holds the NFT.\

This will allow for greater diversity and freedom for players to customize their gameplay experience according to their playstyle and preferences. Additionally, players with varying budgets will be able to purchase NFTs that fit their financial means.

### Seasonal Events

Megura plans to offer seasonal events throughout the year that will allow players to mint limited editions of collectibles that can be used within the game. These events will offer a unique opportunity for players to obtain rare or exclusive items that are only available for a limited time.

The collectibles may include items such as weapons, skins, or other in-game assets, each with their own unique designs and characteristics. The collectibles may also have different rarities, with some being more difficult to obtain than others. These seasonal events will create a sense of excitement and engagement among players, as they compete to obtain the most coveted and valuable items.

The seasonal events will be designed to be accessible to players of all skill levels and backgrounds, and will offer a variety of challenges and activities to participate in. By minting these limited edition collectibles, players will be able to show off their achievements and obtain bragging rights within the game community.

### **Flexibility for gamers**

Megura's vision is to be as flexible as possible to accommodate a wide range of gamers. Although it may not result in direct profit gains for the project, the ability for players to trade their assets will open up many opportunities for players to earn profits and gain recognition within the gaming community.

Megura aims to provide a platform that enables players to access a variety of different gaming assets and NFTs that can be traded and utilized to enhance their gaming experiences.

### **Game downloadability and NFT crossover projects**

In the future, Megura plans to release an actual downloadable game that can be played on mobile, PC, and console. This game will not only provide an additional layer of engagement for players, but it will also allow other NFT projects to create their own gaming assets that can be implemented into the game as crossover projects. This will enable players to access even more unique and exciting NFTs, while also promoting collaboration and cross-promotion between different NFT projects.

By integrating these assets into the game, Megura aims to create a more immersive and interactive gaming experience for its players.

### Simplify wallet-creation process

Megura's plan to skip the wallet-creation process and allow players to mint assets through a Discord bot using a centralized wallet. Why centralized wallet? We aim for the following:

1. **Simplified minting process**: By skipping the wallet-creation process, Megura can simplify the asset minting process, making it easier for players to mint their assets and get started with the game quickly.
2. **Cross-blockchain compatibility**: By allowing players to mint assets using a centralized wallet, Megura can cater to players and holders from different blockchains, increasing the potential player base for the game.
3. **Lower transaction fees**: Using a centralized wallet can potentially reduce transaction fees for players, making it more affordable for them to mint assets and participate in the game.

We understand that it may have underlying security risks, limited control and potential for centralization so we will address them by giving players the option to send their assets to their own wallets in the future. This allows players to have more control over their assets and can increase the overall security of the platform.

Additionally, by providing players with the option to create their own wallet, Megura can ensure that it remains decentralized while also onboarding new players. This can help to maintain the project's decentralization goals and reputation within the blockchain community.

### Megura is more than a project

It's worth noting that Megura is a brand that will continue to expand in the future. **Project DAHLIA** is the first part of this franchise, and Megura aims to add more to the Messinia Graciene universe in the future. By expanding the Messinia Graciene brand, Megura aims to provide players with even more engaging and immersive experiences that take advantage of the full potential of blockchain technology.
