# ðŸŽ¨ For Designers

**Megura** is an inclusive community that welcomes artists of all kinds. From writers to illustrators, musicians to game developers, anyone can contribute and promote their work within the game. As part of this commitment to promoting creativity, Megura will be providing media kits to all artists, as well as the ability to customize their own NFTs.

Artists can use these media kits to showcase their work within the game, whether it be through illustrations, music tracks, or even in-game content such as quests and storylines. They can also create and customize their own NFTs, which can be used within the game or traded on the global market. This gives artists the opportunity to monetize their work and build their own collections of digital assets.

Megura believes that creativity and collaboration are essential for creating a vibrant and engaging gaming experience. By providing the tools and resources for artists to showcase their work and connect with the community, Megura is helping to foster a community of creators, developers, and gamers. So whether you're an established artist or just starting out, Megura welcomes you to join the community and contribute your talents to the game!
