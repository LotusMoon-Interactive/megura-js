# ðŸ–¥ For Developers

**Megura** is a community-driven project focused on delivering an engaging and immersive gaming experience to players. To achieve this goal, the project has been developed as a closed source project, written in Javascript and Node.JS.

Megura is not intended to be a closed project forever, however. We have plans to eventually open up the repository of the game to the public, giving other developers the opportunity to create their own versions of the bot. This will enable other developers to customize the game to their own needs, adding new features and functionalities, and creating unique gameplay experiences for their own communities. By doing this, Megura hopes to encourage collaboration and innovation within the blockchain gaming community.

To ensure that the project remains open and accessible to all developers, Megura will follow the GNU General Public License v3 or later. This license guarantees that the project will remain open source, allowing anyone to view, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit. By adhering to this license, Megura is committed to promoting openness, collaboration, and innovation within the blockchain gaming community.
