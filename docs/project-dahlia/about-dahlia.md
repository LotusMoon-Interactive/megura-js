## Origin

Cerberon first met Dahlia during the medieval period, and was struck by her intelligence and wit at such a young age. Later on, he named his portal project after her, calling it Project DAHLIA. The early prototypes of the system were designed to open and close portals, allowing Cerberon to enter different timelines and explore the mysteries of Eldelvain. As the project evolved, Cerberon added a battle system to protect himself from the dangers that he encountered in his travels. Project DAHLIA became a powerful tool for Cerberon, enabling him to traverse time and space in his quest for knowledge and understanding.

Project DAHLIA is an important aspect of the game's lore and history, providing a unique backstory for Cerberon and his adventures in Eldelvain. The system's evolution from a simple portal mechanism to a powerful battle tool reflects Cerberon's resourcefulness and ingenuity, and adds depth and complexity to the game's world-building.
