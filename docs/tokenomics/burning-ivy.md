As players progress through the game and accumulate tokens, they will have the option to trade them on the global market. The global market provides a platform for players to exchange their tokens for in-game items or other digital assets. It is the only place where tokens can be exchanged for goods, as tokens earned cannot be directly traded between players.

The global market offers a wide range of items and assets that players can acquire using their tokens. These items can range from powerful weapons and armor to unique NFT collectibles and rare digital assets. Players can also use the market to sell their own items and assets, offering them to other players in exchange for tokens. As such, the global market serves as a crucial hub for trading and exchanging digital assets within the game.

Whether players are looking to acquire rare items, sell their own assets, or simply exchange tokens with other players, the global market is the go-to destination for all their trading needs.
