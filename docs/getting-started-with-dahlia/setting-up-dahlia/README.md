# ðŸ›  Setting up Dahlia

Dahlia is a versatile bot for any kind of Discord servers. While it boasts as a storytelling bot, she can also help with server management, including audit logs, verification with Captcha, Whitelist shop, Twitter raids, and roles.

However, Dahlia does not scan servers for permissions and privileges by default, as she does not require the administrator role. That means you will have to check she can see the channels and messages so she can interact with you.

{% hint style="danger" %}
She can be given administrator role but please take caution. Doing this will override a lot of permission checks from her and be able to execute commands if left unchecked. For example, she can delete channels without confirmation if you executed a command such as `/close`. This is irreversible!
{% endhint %}

Please note that Dahlia is still in beta version and improves over time. If you encounter any errors while executing a command, please contact us immediately.
