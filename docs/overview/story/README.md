# ðŸ“” Story

## Synopsis

"Messinia Graciene" is an intriguing story of two individuals, Cerberon and Margaretha, who embark on a time-traveling adventure through the realm of Eldelvain. However, their journey is anything but ordinary. The unique twist in their tale is that each time they die, a mysterious portal opens up and transports them to a different time and place, complete with new identities, names, and surroundings.

As Cerberon and Margaretha explore the many timelines of their lives, they encounter a variety of challenges, obstacles, and adventures. At one point, Cerberon becomes obsessed with the idea of understanding and unraveling the mystery behind their time-traveling experience. He establishes Project D.A.H.L.I.A., a scientific research initiative aimed at forcing the portal to open on demand and investigating the strange phenomenon.

Meanwhile, Margaretha grows increasingly disillusioned with the cycle of death and rebirth that she and Cerberon are trapped in. She longs to break free from the cycle and create a new life for herself. As a result, Margaretha avoids Cerberon whenever possible and tries to forge her own path, even if it means going against him and his scientific endeavors.

The story of "Messinia Graciene" is a fascinating exploration of time, identity, and the human spirit. It raises important questions about the nature of existence and the possibility of breaking free from the constraints of fate and destiny.

## The Creative Process

**Megura** was founded with a mission to bring together communities across different blockchains. While Web3 games have started to utilize non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and their unique traits, extending this functionality across blockchains remains an underdeveloped area. Discord, with its widespread usage among NFT communities, is the ideal venue for facilitating cross-chain interactions.

Role-playing game (RPG) bots have been in existence for a while now, and have experienced significant success in Web2 environments, such as EPIC RPG, Tofu, Tatsu, and Discord Dungeons. Megura aims to build upon this success by offering players the opportunity to immerse themselves in a rich and dynamic world that integrates their NFTs and their unique traits into gameplay.

By using their NFTs as a representation of themselves, players can engage in both PvE (Player versus Environment) and PvP (Player versus Player) battles, using the unique traits of their NFTs to gain an advantage in combat. Megura's worldbuilding offers players an opportunity to explore new frontiers, engage with other players across different blockchains, and compete in a variety of challenges and adventures.

## Why NEAR Protocol?

**NEAR Protocol** and **Megura** both aim to bring together communities across different blockchains. NEAR Protocol's unique sharding technology, powered by Nightshade, enables faster and more efficient transaction processing by splitting data processing into smaller pieces that are distributed across multiple nodes. This makes it ideal for games and on-chain processes, which require speed and scalability. The appeal of NEAR Protocol's design has attracted numerous developers to the platform, resulting in a growing number of games and applications.

In addition to its sharding technology, NEAR Protocol is also known for its sustainability and user-friendly interface. The platform is one of the few carbon-neutral blockchain technologies, and it offers a seamless and intuitive user experience that makes it easy for new users to get started. By leveraging NEAR Protocol's features, Megura is able to offer a seamless and immersive gaming experience that spans across different blockchains, providing players with unprecedented access to a range of new features and opportunities.
