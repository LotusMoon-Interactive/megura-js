# âœ¨ Our Features

Citizens of Eldelvain will be welcomed with plenty of gaming features.

## Gamified staking

Players can earn tokens by participating in various game modes, events, and giveaways. These activities provide a fun and engaging way for players to earn rewards while also promoting participation in the game's community.

## Daily, weekly and monthly quests&#x20;

The game offers daily, weekly, and monthly quests for players to complete, providing an optional but highly recommended way to improve their characters. By finishing these quests, players can earn tokens, in-game items, bonus stats, experience (EXP), and other rewards.

## Raids and server-wide bosses

Later in the game, players will have the opportunity to team up with other Citizens and take on challenging raids and server-wide bosses. These epic battles offer opportunities to earn rewards and gain new experiences forming lasting bonds with other members of the game's community.

## Faction Wars and Player versus Player (PvP)

There'll be two factions that will be introduced: Margaretha and Cerberon. Guilds can participate in faction wars to earn bonuses such as experience points (EXP) and IURA. These wars provide a competitive and challenging way for players to engage with the game's community and progress through the game. By competing in faction wars, players can learn new strategies and tactics, and form lasting alliances with other members of their guild.

## Leaderboard

Leaderboards showcase the top-ranked players across Eldelvain and other worlds, adding an extra level of competition to the game. It is an important aspect of the game's design, providing players with a sense of accomplishment and recognition for their achievements in the game.

## Player versus Environment (PvE)

For players who prefer not to engage in player-versus-player (PVP) modes, the game offers equal opportunities for equipment and rewards regardless of their NFT collection. The game strives to maintain balance across all collections, ensuring that all players can progress through the game and earn rewards at their own pace. This approach promotes inclusivity and fairness, while also allowing players to focus on the aspects of the game that they enjoy most.

## Customized bot personality

The integration of ChatGPT in our project empowers Discord community owners and users with the ability to tailor the personality and style of the Discord bot to their preferences. By offering a selection of pre-set personalities or the option to create a completely unique persona, we ensure that interactions with the bot are not only enjoyable but also truly distinctive. This customization fosters a more engaging and immersive experience for users, as the bot adapts to resonate with their individual tastes, creating a lively and dynamic atmosphere within the Discord community.

Overall, the game's commitment to balance and fairness is a key aspect of its design, providing players with a fun and engaging gaming experience that caters to all play styles.
